Legalizing 20 illegal cells...
Starting legalizer.
Warning: There is high fragmentation caused by many blockages or fixed cells.
        The median subrow width (space between blockages) is 98 sites
        and the median cell width is 27 sites. This makes it difficult for
        the legalizer to pack in the cells and can result in high
        displacements and long runtimes. (PSYN-1012)
